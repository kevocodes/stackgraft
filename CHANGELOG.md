## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-31

First public release.

### Added

- **The skill.** An [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) folder read by roughly forty agents: `SKILL.md` plus `references/`, `assets/` and `scripts/`. No per-agent adapters.
- **Selective overlay.** Starts only the services a git worktree changed, on candidate ports, wiring every unchanged dependency back to the base stack already running.
- **A cached topology manifest** under `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, keyed by the git common directory so every worktree of a repository shares one. Invalidation is per slice: a drifted source re-derives only the manifest keys it owns.
- **Discovery that prefers each ecosystem's own resolver** over hand-parsing — leading with `docker compose config --no-interpolate`, which resolves overrides, `extends` and `include` without expanding a secret — and degrades to a marked static parse rather than failing.
- **The shared-state gate.** Every `(service, store)` pair receives a verdict before anything launches: reuse, isolate inside the running instance, or refuse. Unknown resolves to refusal, and emptiness is a claim requiring evidence at every level.
- **A discovered-template contract.** Isolation commands come from the repository and are therefore untrusted: closed placeholder set, a deny-list on the template's own grammar, argv execution with no shell fallback, and rejection of any program that would re-parse an argument as code.
- **Two POSIX `sh` helpers** needing only `git` and `awk`. Neither reads stdin by default, because for a tool an agent invokes, hanging is worse than failing.
- **A Claude Code plugin** wrapping the same folder, for one-command install.
- **A verification suite** run in CI on every push, including a job that exercises the helpers on Alpine with nothing but `git`, `dash` and busybox `awk`.
